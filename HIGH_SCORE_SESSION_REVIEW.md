# High Score Per Session Calculation and Display Review

## Overview

The AI Snake game implements a dual leaderboard system that tracks both session-specific and all-time high scores. This review examines how high scores are calculated, stored, and displayed during each gaming session.

## Architecture

### 1. Dual Leaderboard System

The game uses two separate leaderboards:

- **Session Leaderboard**: In-memory only, resets when the game is restarted
- **All-Time Leaderboard**: Persistent, saved to `leaderboard.json` file

```python
# From src/ai_snake/render/renderer.py
self.leaderboard = Leaderboard(self.leaderboard_file)  # All-time leaderboard (persistent)
self.session_leaderboard = Leaderboard(file_path=None)  # Session leaderboard (in-memory)
```

### 2. LeaderboardService Integration

The `LeaderboardService` class manages both leaderboards simultaneously:

```python
# From src/ai_snake/game/leaderboard_service.py
class LeaderboardService:
    def __init__(self, file_path: Optional[str] = "leaderboard.json"):
        self.leaderboard = Leaderboard(file_path)  # All-time
        self.session_leaderboard = Leaderboard(file_path=None)  # Session
    
    def add_entry(self, episode: int, reward: float, death_type: str, high_score: bool = False):
        self.leaderboard.add_entry(episode, reward, death_type, high_score=high_score)
        self.session_leaderboard.add_entry(episode, reward, death_type, high_score=high_score)
```

## High Score Calculation Process

### 1. Episode Completion

When an episode ends, the game controller determines if the current score is a high score:

```python
# From src/ai_snake/game/game_controller.py (lines 357-360)
# Add to both leaderboards using the persistent episode_count
# Determine if this is a session high score by comparing reward with session's highest reward
session_entries = self.leaderboard_service.get_session_entries()
session_highest_reward = max([entry.get('reward', 0) for entry in session_entries]) if session_entries else 0
high_score_flag = last_reward >= session_highest_reward and last_reward > 0
self.leaderboard_service.add_entry(self.episode_count, last_reward, death_type, high_score=high_score_flag)
```

### 2. High Score Determination

The high score flag is determined by comparing the current episode's reward against the session's highest reward:

```python
# From src/ai_snake/game/game_controller.py (lines 357-360)
# Determine if this is a session high score by comparing reward with session's highest reward
session_entries = self.leaderboard_service.get_session_entries()
session_highest_reward = max([entry.get('reward', 0) for entry in session_entries]) if session_entries else 0
high_score_flag = last_reward >= session_highest_reward and last_reward > 0
```

### 3. Leaderboard Entry Creation

Each leaderboard entry contains:

```python
# From src/ai_snake/render/leaderboard.py
class LeaderboardEntry:
    def __init__(self, episode: int, reward: float, death_type: str, timestamp: Optional[float] = None, high_score: bool = False):
        self.episode = episode
        self.reward = reward
        self.death_type = death_type
        self.timestamp = timestamp or datetime.now().timestamp()
        self.previous_rank: Optional[int] = None
        self.rank_change = 0
        self.high_score = high_score
```

## Display Implementation

### 1. Session Leaderboard Display

The session leaderboard is displayed in the right panel of the game interface:

```python
# From src/ai_snake/render/renderer.py (lines 340-370)
# --- SESSION LEADERBOARD ---
session_title = FONT.render("SESSION TOP 10", True, (100, 255, 255))
self.screen.blit(session_title, (x_offset, y_offset))

session_entries = self.session_leaderboard.get_formatted_entries()
for entry in session_entries:
    high_score_flag = " HighScore=true" if entry.get('high_score', False) else ""
    line = f"{entry['rank']}. Ep {entry['episode']} - Reward: {entry['reward']:.2f} ({entry['death_type']}){high_score_flag} {entry['arrow']} {entry['change_text']}"
    line_surf = FONT_SMALL.render(line, True, entry['color'])
    self.screen.blit(line_surf, (x_offset, y_offset))
```

### 2. High Score Flag Display

High scores are marked with a special flag in the display:

```python
# Display format example:
# "1. Ep 5 - Reward: 250.00 (SELF) HighScore=true ↑ +2"
```

### 3. Session Statistics

The session leaderboard also displays summary statistics:

```python
# From src/ai_snake/render/renderer.py (lines 365-370)
stats = self.session_leaderboard.get_stats()
if stats:
    stats_text = f"Highest: {stats['highest_reward']:.2f}  Avg: {stats['average_reward']:.2f}  Lowest: {stats['lowest_reward']:.2f}"
    stats_surf = FONT_SMALL.render(stats_text, True, (200, 200, 200))
    self.screen.blit(stats_surf, (x_offset, y_offset))
```

## Key Features

### 1. Real-time Updates

- High scores are updated immediately when a new episode achieves a higher reward
- The session leaderboard is sorted by reward value (descending)
- Only the top 10 entries are maintained in each leaderboard

### 2. Visual Indicators

- **Color coding**: Green arrows (↑) for improving rank, red arrows (↓) for declining rank
- **High score flag**: "HighScore=true" appears next to session high scores
- **Rank changes**: Shows position changes between episodes

### 3. Session Isolation

- Session leaderboard is completely separate from all-time leaderboard
- Session data is lost when the game is restarted
- All-time leaderboard persists across game sessions

## Data Flow

```
Episode Ends
    ↓
Calculate Reward
    ↓
Check if High Score
    ↓
Add to Session Leaderboard
    ↓
Add to All-Time Leaderboard
    ↓
Update Display
    ↓
Show High Score Flag (if applicable)
```

## Testing Results

The test suite confirms that:

1. ✅ Session leaderboard correctly identifies highest rewards
2. ✅ High score flags are properly displayed
3. ✅ Session and all-time leaderboards work independently
4. ✅ Display formatting includes high score indicators

## Summary

The high score per session system provides:

- **Immediate feedback**: Players can see their best performance in the current session
- **Session tracking**: Separate from all-time records for focused improvement
- **Visual clarity**: Clear indicators for high scores and performance trends
- **Real-time updates**: Leaderboard updates instantly as episodes complete

The implementation is robust, well-tested, and provides a comprehensive view of both session-specific and historical performance.

## Issue Resolution

**Problem**: Session high scores were not showing up during the game because the high score flag was being determined incorrectly.

**Root Cause**: The code was comparing `self.state_manager.game_state.score` (game score) with `self.high_score` (session high score), but the leaderboard entries use `reward` values, not `score` values.

**Solution**: Fixed the high score detection logic to compare the current episode's reward with the session's highest reward:

```python
# Before (incorrect):
high_score_flag = self.state_manager.game_state.score == self.high_score

# After (correct):
session_entries = self.leaderboard_service.get_session_entries()
session_highest_reward = max([entry.get('reward', 0) for entry in session_entries]) if session_entries else 0
high_score_flag = last_reward >= session_highest_reward and last_reward > 0
```

This ensures that session high scores are correctly identified and displayed with the "HighScore=true" flag in the leaderboard.
